>â€œThe most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it? It's the next one. Always the next step." <br> -Brandon Sanderson, Oathbringer


Hello everyone, 

Welcome to silesh.com. This is where I will add everything that i feel is worth documenting. Blog posts, guides, reviews, rants and so on. This is the first time I'm trying something of this sort, so I expect most of these initial posts to be of sub par quality. But it is something.

This site was made using jekyll and is hosted through github pages. Info about me can be seen in the about panel. Hope you find something interesting while you're here.

Thanks for visiting,
Silesh
