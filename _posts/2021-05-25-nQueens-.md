N queens is a basic backtracking problem that drives home some very important concepts. The problem statement is as follows:
Place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

For example, for n = 4 and n=8:
Can be satisfied with the following arrangements:

_A solution for n=4_

![Desktop View](../../assets/img/nQueens/n=8.png){: width="400"}
_A solution for n=8_

Essentially the problem is one that involves searching for valid arrangements. The simplest way to achieve this is to do a brute force search on all possible arrangements and see if we can find a valid one. One queen can be placed on each row, and we have n rows. Therefore the total number of possibilities for placing n queens is n*n*n*n.... or n^n which is quite a large number.
This is clearly not the solution. In reality, there are several conditions we can consider before deciding to place a piece on the board. We can rule out several possibilities based on if a cell is under attack already, for each of the n queens we want to position.

This is where backtracking comes into picture. Backtracking simply refers to trying again from a previous state if the current state is not valid. It essentially boils down to the following simple algorithm:

1. Place the ith queen on a valid square.
2. Try placing the (i+1)th queen on a valid square, if possible, continue.
3. If not, then position of the ith queen is not usable, go to step 1 and try again with a different position.

#### Backtracking is usually done by recursively calling a method with different arguments. This is similar to doing DFS on a tree (where each intermittent state is a node and the valid final states are nodes at depth n, and we're simply searching to reach these nodes)

To do this in an efficient manner, we need to consider the following things: (state here refers to the arrangement at any point)

1. How to encode each state in a simple manner
2. How to determine if a state is valid.

### How to represent each state
There are some facts we can work with here:
* Each row can only have one Queen, so we need to represent n rows (thats an array of size n)
* The position of each Queen in that particular row can be represented only by its column number (1-n)

So to represent a state we simply need to use an n dimensional array with integers ranging from 1 to n

### How to determine if a placement is valid:
We need to enforce that no two queens end up on the:
* the same row
* the same column
* the same Diagonal
* the same anti-diagonal

The row constraint will be satisfied since we use an array of integers. The check the others we need to iterate through elements 1-i before placing queen in row i+1. A column is only valid if no queens have been placed there before. The diagonal and anti-diagonal is a little trickier. We need a mathematical condition that satisfies each diagonal and anti-diagonal. Conveniently there is a property that we can make use of.
For diagonals, consider the equation c-r, where c is the column number and r is the row number:

![Desktop View](../../assets/img/nQueens/dig.png)
_column - row number_

We can see that this is consistent for each diagonal
Similarly, for anti diagonals we can use the equation c+r:

![Desktop View](../../assets/img/nQueens/dig.png)
_column + row number_

So putting all these together, to check if a queen can be placed in a particular column in a row, we check each previously placed queen and ensure that, the column has not been used, the c-r value has not been used and the c+r value has not been used by any previously placed queen. 
Our recursive function takes 1 argument, the state. We add the state to result if it has n columns added. If not, we iterate through each column and we check with the already added columns to see if it is a valid one, if yes, we call our method with a new state.

## Python code
```python
def solve(state,n):
  if len(state) ==n:
	#n values are there in state, so state is complete, add to result
    results.append(state)
  else:
    row = len(state)
    for col in range(n):
      #check if column is valid by comparing to previous rows
      valid = True
      for i in range(row):
        #state[i] is the column of the ith row a queen is placed in, we are checking the 3 conditions, column, diagonal and anti diagonal here
        if state[i] == col or state[i]-i == col-row or state[i]+i == col+row:
          valid = False
          break
      if valid:
        #calling the solve method with a new state
        solve(state+[col], n)	

#driver code
results = []
n = 8
state = []
solve(state,n)
for sol in results:
  for i in sol:
    print(["."*i + "Q" + "."*(n-i-1)])
  print()
```
