Before we delve into adding more complex features, it would be better to add some other core necessities that a server needs. I'm referring to user authentication. Currently all of the APIs can be used by anyone, this should not be the case and we should ideally authenticate users and allow operations only post that. We'll start by making some changes to the user schema and then authenticating and whitelisting some requests. First we will look at authenticating each request with credentials and then switch to authenticating once and using a token subsequently.

## Credential based authentication

The simplest form of authentication we can add to our server is by using credentials directly to verify each request. This would involve comparing the incoming username/password fields directly to the ones stored in the db. First lets add a password field to the user schema:
 
#### user.model.js
``` javascript
const userSchema = new Schema({
    name : { type: String, required: true},
    email : {type: String, required: true, unique: true, trim: true, minlength: 5},
    password: {type: String, required: true, minlength: 6}
}, {
    timestamps: true,
});
```

Now what we need to do is to verify this password in every request that comes to the server. Express provides an easy way to do this using middleware functions. A middleware function is simply a function that has access to the request object and the response object. We can simply define an auth method and use it as an application level middleware, this will be executed with each request. Lets create a method in a new file called auth.js, and use this in server.js.

Since we are using postman, we can use the basic auth configuration from postman. This takes a username and password, concatnates them to a string like ```username:password``` and then base64 encodes it. This is then stored under the ```authorization``` header in the format ```Bearer <value>```. So we have to split it, decode it and split it again to get the username and password.

#### auth.js
``` javascript
let User = require('../models/user.model');
const whitelist = ['/users']

//Method for reading the request object
const doAuth = function (req, res, next) {
    if (whitelist.includes(req.originalUrl)) {
        next();
    }
    try {
        const authorization = Buffer.from(req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1], 'base64').toString().split(':');
        const email = authorization[0]
        const password = authorization[1]

        //find one user that matches the email id
        User.findOne({ "email": email })
            .then(user => {
                //if no entry was found that means the email was not in db
                if (!user) {
                    res.status(403).json({
                        error: {
                            message: 'user not registered'
                        }
                    });
                }
                //if passwords match proceed to the next method, which will call the correct router for the api path
                if (user.password === password) {
                    next();
                } else {
                    //if passwords dont match responsd with 403
                    res.status(403).json({
                        error: {
                            message: 'password incorrect'
                        }
                    });
                }
            })
            .catch(err => res.status(403).json({
                error: {
                    message: 'Auth Failed db error: ' + err
                }
            }));
    } catch (err) {
        //catch the errors that occur during parsing the authorization header
        res.status(403).json({
            error: {
                message: "authorization invalid"
            }
        });
    }
}

//export the method so it can be used
module.exports = doAuth;
```

We should add the password to our users post API:

#### users.js
``` javascript
router.route('/').post((req, res) => {
    //get name and email from payload
    ({name, email, password} = req.body);
    //create new user object
    const newUser = new User({"name": name, "email": email, "password": password});
	   
	newUser.save()
        .then(() => res.json('user added successfully'))
        .catch((err)=> res.status(400).json('error: ' + err));

	});

```

The middleware is simply used in the main server.js by doing ```app.use(method)```. This ensures that any request coming to the server first passes through the middleware and then from there it is forwarded to the right place by the ```next``` method. We can also make this specific to certain endpoints like ```app.use('/test', method)```. This way only the requests that match the path are going to go through the middleware. 
#### server.js

``` javascript
const auth = require('auth');
//Use auth method as the middleware to do authentication
app.use(auth);
```

Lets create some new Users that have the password field and then lets use their credentials to access the products list. Trying with no credentials enters the outer catch block and throws one error:

_with invalid credentials_

Doing the same with an invalid email throws a different error:
![Desktop View](/assets/img/ECOM/products-notfound_8tHBoizGC5.png)
_with incorrect email_

And finally trying to do the same with the correct credentials gets us the product list:

_Post the product details_

## Token based authentication

It can be clearly seen how using credentials for every single api call can carry a big risk with it. In an actual working environment, the user enters his password once to log in from the browser. Now if the password is needed for each subsequent request, the browser will have to save the password in memory which is a massive security risk.
The ideal scenario would be something that allows the user to log in with his credentials once and then make each request with some sort of a shared access key which can be validated by the server to provide access. This way rather than sending the password with each request, which is a secret that doesnt change often and so is more sensitive, we can instead use a time limited token.

For now this can be accomplished by generating a random string which can be stored in the db along with an expiry timestamp. This string can be sent to the user and used as a token subsequently. To ensure uniqueness we can include a timestamp component while generating the string, so something like 5 random characters and the timestamp which are then base64 encoded can be used.
When a request is made with the token, we will have to validate the token by checking against the db, and we will also have to verify that the token is not expired.
If it is expired then a new token needs to be generated.

The basic workflow can be seen with a sequence diagram:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/ECOM/tokenflow_G1fzn8CiYNt.png)
_workflow sequence_

To get started lets create a new schema where the auth token and its timestamp will be saved. 

#### token.model.js

``` javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const tokenSchema = new Schema({
    expiry : { type: Number, required: true},
    token : {type: String, required: true, unique: true, trim: true},
}, {
    timestamps: true,
});

const Token = mongoose.model('Token', tokenSchema);
module.exports = Token;

```

So we have 2 fields, token and expiry. When we create a token we will add it along with an expiry. When a token is used we will compare the current timestamp with the expiry to verify if the token is still valid. A new route and service for generating the token also needs to be created:

#### auth.js
``` javascript

//Method for creating an access token
const createToken = function (req, res) {
    try {
        const authorization = Buffer.from(req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1], 'base64').toString().split(':');
        const email = authorization[0]
        const password = authorization[1]

        //find one user that matches the email id
        User.findOne({ "email": email })
            .then(user => {
                //if no entry was found that means the email was not in db
                if (!user) {
                    res.status(403).json({
                        error: {
                            message: 'user not registered'
                        }
                    });
                }
                //if passwords match proceed to the next method, which will call the correct router for the api path
                if (user.password === password) {
                    //get current date and time in milliseconds
                    const now = new Date();
                    const nowinMillis = now.getTime();
                    //create a random string of length 5
                    const randomString = Math.random().toString(36);
                    //base64 encode the random+time string
                    const token = Buffer.from(randomString+nowinMillis.toString()).toString('base64');
                    const expiry = now+60000 //60 seconds
                    //create a new token object with expiry
                    const newToken = new Token({"token": token, "expiry": expiry});
                    //save new user object
                    newToken.save()
                        .then(() => res.json({
                            "token": token
                        }))
                        .catch((err)=> res.status(400).json('error: ' + err));
                } else {
                    //if passwords dont match responsd with 403
                    res.status(403).json({
                        error: {
                            message: 'password incorrect'
                        }
                    });
                }
            })
            .catch(err => res.status(403).json({
                error: {
                    message: 'Auth Failed db error: ' + err
                }
            }));
    } catch (err) {
        //catch the errors that occur during parsing the authorization header
        res.status(403).json({
            error: {
                message: "authorization invalid"
            }
        });
    }
};

//export the method so it can be used
module.exports = {doAuth, createToken};
```

This is mostly exactly the same code as the credential verification that we saw earlier. The only difference is that now, we create a new token object and save that in db. This is then returned back in the response as well. The generation of random string component was done by ```Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,7)```. This is quite interestinhg in the way it works:

```Math.random()``` generates a random decimal between 0 and 1, ```0.6166062056552559``` for example.
A ```number.toString()``` method takes an argument between 2 and 36, which tells what base to convert it to. 2 is binary, 16 is hex and 36 is \[0-9a-z\]. So doing ```0.6166062056552559.toString(36)``` gives us ```"0.m74dncqkw7"```. We just need to do substring between 2 and 7 to get 5 characters ```m74dn```. 

Now that we have a way to generate a token, lets also use it. We can modify the current middleware doAuth method which takes username and password to instead find the token in the db. If a token is found and it is within its expiry, then we continue, otherwise we delete the token from db and respond with error.

#### auth.js
``` javascript
//add token endpoint also to the whitelist
const whitelist = ['/users', '/token']
...

//Method for reading the request object and verifying token
const doAuth = function (req, res, next) {
    if (whitelist.includes(req.originalUrl)) {
        return next();
    }
    try {
        //token is send as authorization: Bearer <token>
        const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
        //get current date and time in milliseconds
        now = new Date();
        nowinMillis = now.getTime();

        //find one token that matches
        Token.findOne({ "token": token })
            .then(token => {
                //if no entry was found that means the token was not in db
                if (!token) {
                    res.status(403).json({
                        error: {
                            message: 'token invalid'
                        }
                    });
                }
                //if token match, then verify validity and proceed to next
                if (token.expiry > nowinMillis) {
					return next();
                } else {
                    //if token is expired then delete it and respond with 403
                    User.deleteOne({ "token": token }, function (err) {
                        if (err) res.status(400).json('Error: ' + err);
                    })
                        .then(() => res.status(403).json({
                            error: {
                                message: 'token expired, please create a new one'
                            }
                        }));
                }
            })
            .catch(err => res.status(403).json({
                error: {
                    message: 'Auth Failed db error: ' + err
                }
            }));
    } catch (err) {
        //catch the errors that occur during parsing the authorization header
        res.status(403).json({
            error: {
                message: "authorization invalid"
            }
        });
    }
};

...

//export the two methods so it can be used
module.exports = { doAuth, createToken };
```

Now finally we can use the two methods in server.js:

#### server.js
``` javascript
//Use auth method as the middleware to do authentication
app.use(auth.doAuth);
....

//register auth endpoint
app.get("/token", auth.createToken);

....
```

We can see the authentication in action by calling the apis:

## Conclusion and Whats next:

We have managed to make a basic token based authentication for the server, while also learing about express middlewares. This is in no way a production ready implementation of token based authentication, we have a couple of problems. One is that we are storing the passwords as plain text in our db which is a major risk, this can be solved by hashing and salting the passwords before storing. Another one related to the token validation is that we have to make a db call to validate a token, this is not performant. What we need is a way for our server itself to validate the token. We can make use of JWT tokens and signatures to accomplish this. 

Both of these will be addressed in upcoming posts, so stay tuned for those. Thanks for reading!!!
